# Obesity Prediction App

A Machine Learning Model to predict Obesity in people. This project uses RandomForestClassifier Model to train on a given dataset. Interactive GUI is developed using PyQt6.

The dataset used is from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhramasaputra/obesity-based-on-eating-habits-and-physical-cond

The file **description.txt** contains description of each and every variable in dataset.

The file **testApp.py** has the code for traiining dataset using RandomForestClassifier. It also contains the code data preprocessing, visualization, feature selection and model training.
